Pseudouridine (Ψ) is a post-transcriptional RNA modification that functions in both structural non-coding RNAs and protein-coding RNAs. Recent progress in messenger RNA pseudouridylation discovered a considerable amount of mRNA Ψs but their mechanisms of biosynthesis and functions still remain elusive. Here, we developed a Ψ quantitative software, named psiFinder, to identify non-coding RNA Ψs and mRNA Ψs based on the chemical arrest of reverse transcription.
